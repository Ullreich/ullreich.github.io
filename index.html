          <p>We are an open community, consisting of both ETH students, as well as people from the Höngg neighborhood. In our community garden, we build on shared responsibility and self-initiative. All members have the opportunity to get involved and unfold their interests - be it in the organization or in garden design. Together, we maintain all beds and garden elements and celebrate bountiful and healthy harvests. We share both the work and the harvest.</p>
